# Monkeyboard
A Java wrapper for the Monkeyboard DAB/DAB+ and FM Receiver 

You need a running native library installed, check out http://www.monkeyboard.org/tutorials/78-interfacing/87-raspberry-pi-linux-dab-fm-digital-radio for instructions how to get a native library.

You can control the Monkeyboard DAB/DAB+ & FM receiver with this Java Wrapper. It is in very early development stage, so please report any errors etc. to help me improving the Wrapper. Thx!
